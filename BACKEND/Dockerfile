# PREVENT PYTHON FROM WRITING PYC FILES
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# SET WORK DIRECTORY (THIS IS THE CONTAINER FOLDER, LOWERCASE IS FINE HERE)

# 2. INSTALL SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (PYTHON + OPENCV LIBS)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \

# 3. INSTALL PYTHON DEPENDENCIES

# CRITICAL: INSTALL TORCH WITH CUDA 11.8 SUPPORT FIRST
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# 5. CREATE DIRECTORY FOR WEIGHTS (MOUNTED VOLUME IN PROD)
# WE DO NOT COPY WEIGHTS INTO THE IMAGE TO KEEP IT SMALL

# 7. RUN COMMAND
# FIXED: CHANGED "app.main:app" TO "APP.main:app" TO MATCH YOUR FOLDER NAME
# LINUX IS CASE SENSITIVE!
